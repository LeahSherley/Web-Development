            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Leah Sherley. I am passionate about mobile application development, particularly Android app development. I enjoy staying updated with the latest technologies and trends in the mobile development industry, constantly seeking to improve my skills
                and expand my knowledge. In addition to mobile app development, I have experience in web development using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have worked on various projects where I have applied my skills in front-end and
                back-end development.
                <br/> I am also proficient in software project management methodologies, particularly Agile. I have successfully led teams and managed projects using Agile practices, ensuring efficient and timely delivery of high-quality software products.
                <br/> In my free time, I enjoy attending tech meetups and hackathons, where I collaborate with other developers and work on exciting projects. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges in the field of technology.
